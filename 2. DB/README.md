First of all, mysql needed to be installed.

In case of using "apt":
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

In case of using "yum":
sudo yum install mariadb-server

I'm using Centos with package manager "yum", so there are result of using install command.

Also for this was written little script, which install db using yum. It has name "installdb.sh".
